        How did imperial powers and the regions they colonized diverge in their 
        long-term CO₂ emissions patterns, and how did extraction and wartime 
        industrial activity contribute to that divergence?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Nations that have historically been leaders in economic prosperity, 
        rapid industrialization, and/or heavy reliance on fossil fuels have 
        increasingly polluted their atmosphere for the advancement of their 
        own society – better transportation systems, utilities, and social 
        structures (e.g. roads, water, energy, schools, hospitals). However, 
        weaker, developing nations have been abused and exploited by way of 
        green colonialism and/or war; their ecological and political environment 
        de-stabilized for benefits they will never get to see. A legacy of 
        powerful empires’ deliberate sabotage upon the ecology of their victims. 
        Our aim is to see whether these historical dynamics manifest within our 
        <b>simulated</b> dataset, acknowledging that while the data are not real, the 
        stories behind them very much are.

          In the early 20th century, British prospectors discovered oil in Iran and began the first
          large-scale drilling projects. The British government bought a controlling stake in the 
          Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), and by the start of World War&nbsp;I, Iranian oil had become 
          one of Britain’s most important strategic resources. Yet the profits flowed outward: foreign 
          businessmen, engineers, and investors lived comfortably while many Iranians remained in poverty.
          This imbalance fueled resentment and, eventually, the nationalization of Iran’s oil industry 
          under Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, who argued that Iran should benefit from its own reserves.
          In 1953, the CIA and British intelligence orchestrated a coup that overthrew this government 
          and reinstated a monarchy aligned with Western interests — a reminder that control over carbon 
          resources has always been deeply political.

            The atomic bomb on Japan is a unique event in which destruction was brought about not 
              for resource extraction but for the cessation of war. During WWII Japan was the last 
              nation in the Axis power to surrender. The United States had determined that – due to 
              the resiliency of the Japanese – conventional bombing and ground invasions were not 
              sufficient. In August of 1945 the world’s first atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, 
              Japan. Both sides were hoping to do something drastic enough to call for a cease-fire – 
              or better to surrender. Nuclear testing in the 1940s to 1950s produced unusual isotopes 
              in the atmosphere – specifically 14C. Various examinations were done that showed the 
              ratio of 14CO2 to total CO2 rapidly increased during this time. This worldwide public 
              concern over the danger posed by atmospheric radioactive fallout produced by above 
              ground nuclear weapons testing led to the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty signed by the United 
              States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom.

            In December 1952, London was engulfed for five days by the Great Smog, 
              a toxic haze that created a spike in pneumonia and bronchitis cases. The 
              lethal smog was formed by a combination of industrial pollution from coal 
              burning and a period of high pressure weather. It led to an estimated 12,000 
              deaths not including the livestock that was also affected. In response to this 
              crisis, the British government passed the Clean Air Act four years later in 1956,
              which restricted coal burning and helped with the transition to oil, natural gas,
              and electricity. However, if you look at the chart, carbon emissions continue to 
              rise. The smog crisis helped local air pollution but didn't address the overall problem
              of carbon emmissions.

        <strong>Fig. 5</strong> — Vietnam’s fossil-fuel emissions remain modest, but war-driven land-use change 
        and forest loss release carbon that does not appear fully in energy statistics.

        The Vietnam War grew from the long conflicts between France and Vietnam. 
              The Geneva Peace Accords was an attempt to resolve these conflicts signed by 
              France and the communist leaderships of Vietnam – the Soviet Union and the People’s 
              Republic of China – and stipulated that Vietnam be reunified by a national election. 
              However, as cold war tensions continued to build, anxiety seeped through the United 
              States, and unification efforts stalled; the United States became more involved. 
              This conflict pitted the communist North Vietnam against the government of South 
              Vietnam and its principal ally the United States. The deliberate mass removal of 
              vegetation by bombing and chemical defoliants (Agent Orange) sought to eliminate forest 
              cover and with it the carbon it stored was released.
