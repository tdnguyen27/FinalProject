        How has the accumulation of human actions changed the carbon dioxide 
        emissions throughout our history?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Humans have been contributing to climate change for decades, slowly increasing 
        our carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. If humanity isn't careful 
        and continues carelessly increasing our carbon emissions we could be living in a world
        with record high temperatures.

            <p>Global powers have taken advantage of Africa’s resources for centuries.
            During the late 19th century, the Industrial Revolution fueled global demand 
            for diamonds, rubber, and other minerals, driving intensive mining and plantation 
            economies. Much of this activity relied on clearing rainforests, which not only 
            released carbon from land use and farming, but also destroyed a major carbon sink.
            In the chart, you can see that Africa’s recorded carbon emissions rise more slowly 
            than other regions that profitted from its resources such as the United States and 
            Western Europe, reflecting limited local industrialization. It’s only in the 
            post–World War II period, as economies begin to develop and energy use grows, that 
            Africa’s emissions start to climb more sharply.</p>

            <p>In the early 20th century British prospectors discovered oil in Iran and began 
              the first large-scale drilling projects. The British government bought a 
              controlling stake in the Anglo-Iranian oil company (AIOC) and by the start of WWI 
              Iranian oil was Britain’s most important strategic resource. However, this grew 
              resentment in Iranians as foreign businessmen, engineers, and British investors 
              hoarded the wealth and lived lavishly while Iran’s local population lived in 
              poverty. This led to nationalization of Iran’s oil industry by Mohammed Mossadeq – 
              who was the democratically elected prime minister; he argued that Iran should 
              begin profiting from its vast oil reserves. However, in 1953 the CIA and British 
              intelligence orchestrated a coup of this nationalist government for a dictatorship 
              under the Shah who was friendly and relied heavily on western interests. The CIA 
              didn’t acknowledge their key involvement until 2013. </p>

            <p>The atomic bomb on Japan is a unique event in which destruction was brought about not 
              for resource extraction but for the cessation of war. During WWII Japan was the last 
              nation in the Axis power to surrender. The United States had determined that – due to 
              the resiliency of the Japanese – conventional bombing and ground invasions were not 
              sufficient. In August of 1945 the world’s first atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, 
              Japan. Both sides were hoping to do something drastic enough to call for a cease-fire – 
              or better to surrender. Nuclear testing in the 1940s to 1950s produced unusual isotopes 
              in the atmosphere – specifically 14C. Various examinations were done that showed the 
              ratio of 14CO2 to total CO2 rapidly increased during this time. This worldwide public 
              concern over the danger posed by atmospheric radioactive fallout produced by above 
              ground nuclear weapons testing led to the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty signed by the United 
              States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>In December 1952, London was engulfed for five days by the Great Smog, 
              a toxic haze that created a spike in pneumonia and bronchitis cases. The 
              lethal smog was formed by a combination of industrial pollution from coal 
              burning and a period of high pressure weather. It led to an estimated 12,000 
              deaths not including the livestock that was also affected. In response to this 
              crisis, the British government passed the Clean Air Act four years later in 1956,
              which restricted coal burning and helped with the transition to oil, natural gas,
              and electricity. However, if you look at the chart, carbon emissions continue to 
              rise. The smog crisis helped local air pollution but didn't address the overall problem
              of carbon emmissions.</p>

            <p>The vietnam war grew from the long conflicts between France and Vietnam. 
              The Geneva Peace Accords was an attempt to resolve these conflicts signed by 
              France and the communist leaderships of Vietnam – the Soviet Union and the People’s 
              Republic of China – and stipulated that Vietnam be reunified by a national election. 
              However, as cold war tensions continued to build, anxiety seeped through the United 
              States, and unification efforts stalled; the United States became more involved. 
              This conflict pitted the communist North Vietnam against the government of South 
              Vietnam and its principal ally the United States. The deliberate mass removal of 
              vegetation by bombing and chemical defoliants (Agent Orange) sought to eliminate forest 
              cover and with it the carbon it stored was released.  </p>
